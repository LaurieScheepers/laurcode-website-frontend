            <i>A long list of things that I am passionate about, in no order of importance or anything.</i>

            <p></p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Friends & Family</b>: I believe that good connections with people are what makes your life
                    meaningful.
                <li><b>Technology</b>: Software, Internet, Open Source movement, AI, VR, AR, IoT, Biomimicry.</li>
                <li><b>Science</b>: My father, being a scientist in general, inspired a love of Mathematics,
                    Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science and its applications in the world,
                    in me since childhood.
                </li>
                <li><b>Music</b>: I am a musician myself and almost constantly listen to the types of music that appeals
                    to me everywhere I go.
                    Started playing guitar at 11, and take pride in my instrument of choice. “Jamming” with friends and
                    recording it is great!
                </li>
                <li><b>Art</b>: From early on I've been exposed to great art in different mediums.
                    Even though I'm not really <i>that</i> talented, I've had a few art classes in different
                    times in my life and I have created some things I am proud of.
                </li>
                <li><b>Language</b>: I gained a love of languages from my mother who was an English
                    teacher at college level for a long time.
                </li>
                <li><b>Reading Good books</b>: Fiction (all genres) and non-fiction (especially auto-biographies), are
                    one of my great passions and
                    gladly maintained a love of reading since I was 11.
                </li>
                <li><b>Evolution</b>: Reading about Evolution of life, animal and human behaviour on this planet, the
                    only one know that is capable of life.
                </li>
                <li><b>Human Sciences</b>: As my brother is a clinical psychologist, I gained a new appreciation of
                    the study of the human mind, why it works the way it does, and how
                    it can be changed using natural and scientific means.
                </li>
                <li><b>Wikipedia</b>: Free information about anything you can think of!</li>
                <li><b>Animals & Pets</b>: I am a very big fan of animals and pets, especially dogs and cats (cats are
                    my
                    favourite, I have a one-year old girl of a real special breed called a
                    Russian Blue).
                </li>
                <li><b>Soccer</b>: Great sport, and was part of the Paarl Soccer Club Team (central defender),
                    during 1999-2001.
                </li>
                <li><b>Card Games & Tricks</b>: <i>Poker</i>: I have been playing since childhood, preferring real
                    games,
                    but also playing online (Silversands Online Casino) a lot until it was
                    made illegal in SA. <i>Tricks</i>: they are just cool. I developed a unique
                    self-working mathematical card trick to easily check if a deck contains
                    exactly 52 cards, that is much quicker and impressive than just counting
                    the cards.
                </li>
                <li><b>Guitar & Bands</b>: Has been a member of various bands (lead guitar, of which I am very
                    passionate about) during school and university
                    years, and was also part of a serenade group called "Die Kraaie" during hostel years while studying,
                    and I'm looking to start a new musical venture again soon.
                </li>
                <li><b>Tennis</b>: Still love tennis, and achieved Boland Provincial Colours in 2001.</li>
                <li><b>Creative Writing</b>: Editor of high school annual magazine, Die Retina, and annual
                    magazine of Wilgenhof Residence, Die Bliksem, in 2009 & 2011.
                </li>
