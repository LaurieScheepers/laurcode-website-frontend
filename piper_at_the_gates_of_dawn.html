            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Piper_at_the_Gates_of_Dawn" target="_blank">Pink Floyd - The
                Piper at the Gates of Dawn</a></h3>

            <p>A lot of people don't like Pink Floyd. I often hear things like "They are too weird for me".</p>

            <p>If you don't like music like the Floyd's sound, well then I definitely don't suggest listening to this
                album, which is their debut album. If you like psychedelic types of music-genres - make this the next
                album you listen to!</p>

            <p>When Pink Floyd started out it was this English fellow called Syd Barrett who was the genius behind their
                music. He has been called various things in his life: brilliant, ill, misunderstood, mad-man, "crazy
                diamond", erratic, hilarious. I wish we got some more music and art out of this guy, but unfortunately
                after Pink Floyd got famous, he started living a life totally outside of the lime-light,
                only releasing one or two solo albums (which are great as well) but also
                suffered some sort of nervous breakdown after which he started living quite reclusively.</p>

            <p>I had a very big Pink Floyd phase to which my friends would attest, and this was just one of their albums
                I
                listened to on repeat while sometimes skipping class and staying in my "hool" (room) in Wilgenhof, the
                residence I attended in Stellenbosch.
                Piper at the Gates of Dawn is certainly a strange album, and I get that a lot of people would not like
                it at all. But I think it's excellent.</p>

            <p>What a lot of people don't know is that Syd Barrett was definitely a musical genius, and also possibly an
                actual genius. Not only did he totally bring a new psychedelic sound to the world, he was also very well
                read, and I think he knew or thought he knew things most of us would never discover in our
                lifetimes.</p>

            <p>For example, the song Chapter 24 is about the ancient Chinese book, <i>I Ching</i>, aka <i>The Book Of
                Changes</i> (the
                oldest of the so-called "Chinese Classics"):</p>

            <blockquote>
                A movement is done in six stages, and the seventh brings return
            </blockquote>

            <p>Sounds familiar? Maybe like the story
                of Genesis in the Bible? Well, this is something out of the I Ching which is dated to have been written
                somewhere between the 10th and 4th centuries
                BC.</p>

            <p>This album shifts across a lot of boundaries: ancient wisdom (the previously mentioned Chapter 24), space
                (Astronomy Domine), the future (Interstellar Overdrive), JRR Tolkien's works (The Gnome), and one of my
                favourite songs - Bike, a simple song about him wanting to get a girl "into his world". It includes this
                wonderful lyric:</p>

            <blockquote>I know a mouse, and he hasnâ€™t got a house<br>
                I donâ€™t know why I call him Gerald<br>
                Heâ€™s getting rather old, but heâ€™s a good mouse<br></blockquote>

            <p>There's also one other song that is special to me and that is Lucifer Sam, a song about his cat. I love
                cats and I love their crazy complex little minds. Syd also obviously loved his pets.</p>

            <h4>[Verse 1]</h4>

            <blockquote>Lucifer Sam, siam cat<br>
                Always sitting by your side<br>
                Always by your side<br></blockquote>

            <h4>[Hook]</h4>

            <blockquote>That catâ€™s something I canâ€™t explain</blockquote>

            <p>A truly original album from a truly original person ðŸ˜€</p>
