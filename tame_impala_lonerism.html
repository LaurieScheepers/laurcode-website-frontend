            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonerism" target="_blank">Tame Impala - Lonerism</a></h3>

            <p>I‚Äôve listened to this album a few times on holiday when alone on headphones. This is my second Tame
                Impala review so excuse me for that but I really really like this band and the style of music that they
                make. Again, just imagine The Beatles continuing further with their psychedelic phase and this is what
                you would get. It‚Äôs a wonder it‚Äôs taken like 30 years for this type of music to be re-delivered to fans
                like ourselves. Some people call this a revival instead of a totally original musical direction, which
                is probably fine - I don‚Äôt think Kevin Parker, the mastermind behind everything, would mind that
                description.</p>

            <p>Tame Impala creates soundscapes in their songs instead of the typical uni-directional song-writing style
                you‚Äôll find with most artists combined with amazingly simple but catchy melodies. I would say the appeal
                of Tame Impala is 30% creative experimental effects-driven music and 70% melody.</p>

            <p>Even better is Parker‚Äôs lyrics: each song is about some personal thought/wondering/realization that he
                has experienced. The title of the album, Lonerism, describes the themes found in the songs perfectly.
                Parker has said a few times in interviews that he feels he is a loner, living in his own mind, and the
                only way he can give expression for that kind of mind-state is through music. This album is optimistic
                as a whole, while still containing songs about some real deep realizations we can come to about
                situations we see every day - Kevin just writes down his feelings all the time and creates something
                cool with each idea he has.</p>

            <p>This is a guy who has sat alone in his room playing around with effects pedals, recording software and
                various instruments, all on his own, since he was about 13. We are lucky to be able to hear all his
                music (each album is completely written, performed (all instruments), recorded, mixed and mastered by
                himself) and he never disappoints. I‚Äôm looking forward to checking out what is coming next.</p>

            <h4>Highlights:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Be Above It - bad things happening to you, society letting you down</li>
                <li>Endors Toi (which means ‚ÄúFall Asleep‚Äù in French) - a kind of blissful song, guitars are amazing -
                    his use of phaser in this song is nothing short of brilliant, his phaser effect lasts for a whole
                    bar with the guitar playing the chord progression. It‚Äôs a dream for people who like psychedelic
                    guitar effects
                </li>
                <li>Why Won‚Äôt They Talk To Me? - a song about lonely feelings, a bit depressing actually, even though
                    the music doesn‚Äôt reflect that. I guess it‚Äôs about someone feeling that they don‚Äôt ‚Äúfit in‚Äù with
                    certain situations (something we all can probably relate to)
                </li>
                <li>Feels Like We Only Go Backwards - A song about a relationship he has/had in which things seem to
                    progress but ultimately only goes back to where it was originally
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The whole album is a highlight really. Listen to each track and check the lyrics üòÄ</p>
