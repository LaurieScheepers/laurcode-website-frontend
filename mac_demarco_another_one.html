            <p></p>

            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_One_(Mac_DeMarco_album)" target="_blank">Mac DeMarco -
                Another One</a></h3>

            <p>A friend once described Mac's music as "it's like getting stoned with SpongeBob Squarepants and listening
                to his music tastes". I think I can end the review here.</p>

            <p>But I won't! I discovered Mac Demarco early this year by chance (as these things happen), and wow, what a
                guy!</p>

            <p>Canadian-born, currently only 27 years of age, he started making his name by
                doing quite wacky projects - but people quickly realized his talents, and he started kind of gaining a
                cult following at first in Canada and then America. There's even a whole subreddit dedicated to Mac, not
                only
                discussing his music but also his life and personal relationships and worries about his possible
                addiction issues, stuff like that. If you can make an impression like that on your fans; that they start
                to take an interest in your personal life, I think you've made it ðŸ˜€</p>

            <p>Other descriptions of his music include "lazy jazz-rock", "slacker rock" or his self-described term
                "jizz-jazz" (make of that what you want haha).</p>

            <p>"Another one" is a mini-LP containing mostly songs about love, or as he described it "music containing
                songs
                and lyrics about that feeling you get in your chest". It's very mellow, like all his stuff, with great
                guitar and melodies. I think he's trying to tell the world what The Beatles tried over and over - all
                you need is love.</p>

            <p>Also check out Salad Days, his big album that helped him achieve this cult following. Brilliant
                stony-spongebob music ðŸ˜€ And the follow up to that, This Old Dog, containing a bit more personal stuff
                about his relationship with his father.</p>

            <p>So when you finish work and you're in the mood to chill out and relax, and also take a break from
                heavyish rock, containing
                difficult things like anger, depression, self-worry, like a lot of things mentioned in my previous album
                reviews (not saying some of his songs are not about these things, but it's done in a mellow way), put on
                a Mac Demarco album.</p>

            <p>I like this guy, his personality and approach to life. One thing that I *really*
                found amazing is that at the end of each of his albums he has a personal message for the listener ðŸ˜€.
                For
                this one, he gives the actual address of the small room where he recorded this album, saying "Stop by,
                I'll make you a cup of coffee. See you later". Another one he says sincerely "Hi guys, Mac here, hope
                you enjoyed the album and thanks for listening." In another one he talks to a girl in the background who
                fell asleep on his couch telling her that it's time to go to bed.</p>

            <p>What a chill guy.</p>
